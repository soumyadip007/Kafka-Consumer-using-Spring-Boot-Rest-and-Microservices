# Kafka-Consumer-using-Spring-Boot-Rest-and-Microservices
Apache Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds, Kafka works well as a replacement for a more traditional message broker.
